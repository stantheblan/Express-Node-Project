## Application Function:

A virtual store using Express.

This example helps show:
* Interaction between webpages
* Interaction between DB and webpages

This application allows a user to simulate the purchase of an item from a shop that is connected to a database. Not only can the user purchase an item, they can add/edit/or remove items as well.

You can see my **Express Coin Shop** in action here:
